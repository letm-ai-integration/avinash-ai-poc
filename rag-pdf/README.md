# RAG-Based Document Question Answering Application (POC)

This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the development of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that enables users to query PDF documents and receive context-aware answers generated by a local LLM.

## Objective

The goal of this POC is to build an end-to-end pipeline that:
- Processes scanned or digital PDF documents
- Converts document content into embeddings
- Stores and retrieves relevant information using semantic search
- Generates accurate answers grounded in the document content

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a standard RAG workflow:

1. **PDF Ingestion**
   - Accepts scanned or digital PDF documents
   - Extracts text from PDFs (including OCR for scanned files, if applicable)

2. **Tokenization & Embedding Generation**
   - Splits extracted text into manageable chunks
   - Generates vector embeddings for each chunk

3. **Vector Storage**
   - Stores embeddings in a **FAISS** vector database for efficient similarity search

4. **Semantic Search**
   - Performs similarity-based retrieval to find the most relevant document chunks for a user query

5. **Answer Generation**
   - Uses an **Ollama-hosted LLM** to generate answers
   - Responses are grounded strictly in the retrieved document context

## Key Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **FAISS** – Vector database for semantic search
- **Embeddings Model** – For vector representation of document chunks
- **Ollama** – Local LLM for response generation
- **PDF Processing & OCR** – For handling scanned and digital documents

## Features

- Supports PDF document ingestion  
- Semantic search over document content  
- Context-aware question answering  
- Uses locally hosted LLM via Ollama  
- Scalable and extensible RAG pipeline

## Use Case

This POC can be used for:
- Question answering over internal documents
- Knowledge retrieval from reports, manuals, or research papers
- Secure, offline document intelligence using local models

## Status

This is a **Proof of Concept** developed as part of the **LETM program** to explore and validate RAG-based document intelligence using open-source and local LLM technologies.
